## Task description
We have a **pool of questions** and **two datasets** to use to find answers in empirical way.

Substantive **methodological frame** presumes that "tweeting" (as the form of social interaction,
  or a public space, or a space where people complain) is a proxy indicator of social problems.
  Shortly saying, if people text about problem, problem _could_ exist.

**Gathering of datasets were outsourced**, same for some methodological features (i.e.
  categories of problems and their respective "keywords" were provided)

Current **raw report available**, see [[html]](https://htmlpreview.github.io/) [[ipynb]](https://nbviewer.org/)

Current **report available** on demand.
